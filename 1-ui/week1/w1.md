- Audience-Content relation and the Role of Interface in defining the Experience
- Roles in UI/UX development
- Interface Conventions
- Interface Functionalitites
- Interface Aesthetics

## What is a UI?

We can define a user interface as this. User is one who needs a specific content, and the interface is the bridge between the user and the content. Actually,

User -----------> Interface -------> Content

For example, a book is an interface between a reader and a story. Another example would be road signs which is a bridge between drivers and rules.

Nowadays, screens are interfaces between everyone and everything. In other words, the interface is a medium, and actually the medium is the message. The medium affects the messgae. Good interface design conveys good message and on the other hand, bad interface design conveys bad message. Moreover, the interface (medium) affects the experience. So, the interface shapes the experience. So UI shapes UX.

## The relationship between UI and UX

UI is about how your design looks. In other words, the visual design of the interface.  On the other hand, UX is about how it feels (experience) and it is actually non-visual design.

It must be notes that these two concepts are different and as a result, each of them is a different job type. Visual design is actually can be considered as graphic design, on the other hand, non-visual design might involve various tasks such as researching, planning, and testing. 
The UI designer usually focuses on form, aesthetics, look & feel, and organization, while, the UX designer concentrates on feel, navigation, story, and structure. 

**_NOTE:_** UI is driven by design, visual indentity, and surface, while UX is driven by content, engagement, and user.

UI designer concerns about visual design and UX developer focuses on social science.

Keep in mind that user experiences form (interface) before content. 
Designer experiences content before interface, and tries to shape the content and the interface. So the designer developes a special interface for the content.
